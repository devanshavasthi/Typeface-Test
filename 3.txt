Based on these factors, we can design the datastore using a relational database with the following schema:
ServiceMonitoringData:
  - api_name (string): name of the API.
  - user_id (integer): ID of the user making the request.
  - request_time (datetime): timestamp of the request.
  - response_time (integer): response time of the request in milliseconds.
  - error_status (boolean): whether the request resulted in an error.

1.
SELECT api_name, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC

2.
SELECT user_id, api_name, AVG(response_time) AS avg_response_time
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY user_id, api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC

3.
SELECT api_name, request_time, SUM(error_status) / COUNT(*) AS error_percentage
FROM ServiceMonitoringData
GROUP BY api_name, request_time
